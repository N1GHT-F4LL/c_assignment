# Problem B
### Points: 5

## Description

Once upon a time, in a village nestled amidst rolling hills, lived a young mathematician named Ahnax, who was fascinated by numbers. One day, his friend Kevil Pham approached him with a problem written on a parchment:

> **Problem B**
>
> Given a number \(n\), find the sum of its digits.

Excited by the challenge, Ahnax proposed breaking down the number into its digits and summing them. Together, they worked diligently, crunching numbers until Ahnax declared triumphantly, "Eureka!"

With bated breath, Kevil Pham listened as Ahnax revealed the sum of the digits.

And so, with their combined intellect, Ahnax and Kevil Pham conquered Problem A, proving that no challenge was insurmountable.

## Input
A single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{1000}$), with no leading zeros.

- 50% of the test cases will have ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$)
- 50% of the test cases will have ($10^{18} \leq n \leq 10^{1000}$)

## Output
The sum of all digits of the number.

## Requirements
This problem only allow file name with "c" file extension "problem_b.c", another name will be ignored.

## Example
| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 123   | 6      |
| 12345 | 15     |
| 1234567890 | 45 |
