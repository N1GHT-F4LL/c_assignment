# Problem A
### Points: 7

## Description

In a picturesque village surrounded by rolling hills, there resided Antoinee, a young and curious lad with a penchant for unraveling mysteries. One fine day, Antoinee stumbled upon a perplexing enigma concerning the classification of numbers into odd and even.

Driven by an insatiable thirst for knowledge, Antoinee embarked on a coding expedition. With meticulous precision, he forged a formidable program capable of deciphering the fundamental nature of any integer.

After relentless hours of coding and debugging, Antoinee's creation stood ready for the ultimate test. With bated breath, he executed his program, subjecting it to a battery of numerical trials.

As the program sprung to life, it flawlessly discerned the parity of each inputted number, promptly declaring them as either "Even" or "Odd".

Filled with elation, Antoinee shared his triumph with the villagers, earning their admiration and acclaim. Henceforth, he was hailed as the prodigy of numbers, his ingenious program revered far and wide.

With determination in his heart and code in hand, Antoinee ventured forth, ready to conquer new coding challenges and unlock even greater mysteries in the realm of computation.

## Input
A single integer provided by the user. ($1 \leq integer \leq 10^{18}$)
- 50% of the test cases will have ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{9}$)
- 50% of the test cases will have ($10^{9} \leq n \leq 10^{18}$)

## Output
The program should print either "Even" or "Odd" depending on the input number.
## Requirements
This problem only allow file name with "c" file extension "problem_a.c", another name will be ignored.

## Example
| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
