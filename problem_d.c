# Problem D
### Points: 10

## Description


On a small island with no internet connection, mobile phones, or modern means of communication, the inhabitants rely solely on a radio station to receive information from the outside world.

One day, while everyone was busy with their daily tasks, the radio station suddenly broadcasted an urgent message. However, due to unstable signals, the message was repeated multiple times, forming a string of characters that everyone could hear.

To understand the content of the message clearly, the islanders needed to determine the shortest possible string that could be the required information. Therefore, they needed a way to extract the message from this repeated string.

You are tasked with helping the islanders by writing a program that can determine the length of the shortest string containing the required message.
  
## Input
Message string. The string contains only characters from a..z.

## Output

The length of the substring that can be the actual message must be the smallest possible value

## Requirements
This problem only allow file name with "c" file extension "problemd.c", another name will be ignored.

## Example
