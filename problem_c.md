# Problem C
### Points: 5

## Description

In a quaint village nestled amidst rolling hills, DVL, a young mathematician, stumbled upon a puzzling dilemma. Villagers couldn't find a way to identify all prime numbers within a given range.

Intrigued, DVL devised a plan to write a C program. With determination, he crafted a program prompting users to input a range limit.

Through meticulous coding, DVL created a loop to systematically check each number for primality within the range. 

After intense debugging, he successfully unveiled the program to the villagers. Cheers erupted as the program flawlessly displayed all prime numbers within the specified range.
DVL became a village hero, renowned for his problem-solving skills, and the villagers hailed him as their resident genius.

## Input
A single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 10^{7}$)
- 50% of the test cases will have ($1 \leq n \leq 10^{5}$)
- 50% of the test cases will have ($10^{5} \leq n \leq 10^{7}$)

## Output
All prime numbers within the range from 2 to $n$ (inclusive).

## Requirements
This problem only allow file name with "c" file extension "problem_c.c", another name will be ignored.
